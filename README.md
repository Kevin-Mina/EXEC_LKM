# EXEC_LKM
note; the file is called `rootkit.c` because.. I couldn't find a better name for it. heh

A LKM (Loadable Kernel Module) 
to execute a command as root;
I include a example of using netcat and a 
compiled(with source and steps on how to compile) reverse shell provided in C. 

Note, this is not really a rootkit-per-say but __can be__ a part of one, more specifically. Obviously, if that's the case - it's for learning purposes. I Never created this to be used illegally.
